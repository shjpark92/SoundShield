## Sound Shield
* A dynamic noise masking solution
* Fall 2015 - Spring 2016 by Team 17 "Freq Out" Senior Design Project
* The University of Texas at Austin
* Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
* Prototype released on May 9, 2016

## Mission
The goal is to create a software package that could 
run on any home computer system, interfaced with a 
microphone placed outside of the room for receiving 
noise signals and calibrated speakers inside of the 
room responsible for outputting custom sound masks 
that will cover up the environmental noise. 
SoundShield users would be able to simply run the 
software on their own personal computer to immerse 
themselves in their work, rest, conversation, or 
whatever task they may want to stay focused on, 
without being disrupted by noise intruding from 
outside of the room. The solution would achieve 
this by automatically adjusting the intensity levels 
and frequency content of the noise mask being played 
so that it matches that of the noise outside of the 
room, rendering that noise imperceptible to the user.
